# LinkedList-Implementation
A linked list is a data structure used in computer science to store a collection of elements. It consists of a sequence of nodes, where each node contains two fields: data and a pointer to the next node in the sequence.

## Single Linked List operations:
- Insert node at the front
- Insert node at the end
- Insert node at a specific position
- remove a node from the front
- remove a node from the end
- remove a specific node element
- search for an element in the list
- Traverse and print the list elements

## Advantages of using linked list
- Dynamic size - The size of a linked list can easily be changed during runtime.
- Efficient insertion and deletion - Nodes can be added or removed without the need to shift other elements around.
- Memory efficiency - Only the memory needed for the current elements in the list needs to be allocated.

## Disadvantages of using linked list
- No random access - Elements in a linked list can only be accessed by traversing the list from the beginning.
- Extra memory usage - Each node in the list requires additional memory to store the pointer to the next node.
- Overhead - Linked lists have additional overhead compared to arrays, due to the necessary pointers.

## How to use the application:
- You need to download it first then open the main function from any IDE that support C++ language ( recommended: code blocks)
- After running the program it will appear a menu will guide you of the operation and closing after finishing.
